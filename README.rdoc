This app is to help me keep track of things I want to build. There are apps out
there to do it, but I wanted to make one myself. It should help solidify concepts,
and it'll just be cool when I use it.

I want to get more practice with Rails, ActiveRecord, and SCSS. I'll also be using
TDD, because that's always a great idea.
